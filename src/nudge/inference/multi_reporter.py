"""Multi-reporter joint attribution — break the K⇄v_max degeneracy with a panel.

NUDGE's measured, load-bearing weakness is the **K⇄v_max / gain⇄threshold
degeneracy** (``scripts/vv/FINDINGS.md`` §2): a *single* reporter of one latent
switch under-determines the mechanism, so NUDGE abstains. The reason a single
reporter cannot separate a **threshold** shift (where the latent switches) from a
**ceiling** change (the latent's max) is that one affine readout ``y = base +
gain·activity`` cannot tell a change in the *latent's* ceiling apart from a change in
its *own* gain — the two are the same free parameter.

The fix FINDINGS keeps naming: **fit several downstream reporters of ONE latent
switch jointly.** Each reporter ``y_j = base_j + gain_j · A · f(dose; K, n)`` observes
the *same* latent switch ``f`` with its own gain/offset. The mechanisms then project
DIFFERENTLY onto a panel of heterogeneous gains:

- a **threshold** shift moves the inflection in dose **identically** across reporters
  (a shape shift), so only a shared ``K`` change explains all curves at once;
- a **gain** change alters the shared steepness ``n`` identically across reporters;
- a **ceiling** change scales the latent's max ``A`` — hitting **every** reporter's ON
  amplitude by the *same fraction* (because the reporter gains are pinned from the
  control) — which a single reporter cannot distinguish from its own gain drifting, but
  a panel can, because the drop is consistent across heterogeneous gains.

Pinning each reporter's affine from the control and sharing one latent across the panel
makes the perturbed fit **over-determined** (M curves constrain 3 shared knobs) — higher
Fisher information, the degeneracy breaks. This is the multi-reporter analogue of the
second-operating-point ×16 result (``FINDINGS`` "Covariance attribution" M3): more
*reporters* of one latent, instead of more *conditions*.

**Fail-safe — this capability STRENGTHENS the guarantee (against a confound that breaks
the shared latent).** A spurious mechanism must now be consistent across ALL reporters,
which is much harder to fake. And the honest new gate is the **consistency guard**: if the
reporters cannot be explained by one shared latent (a reporter secretly reads a *different*
latent — a hidden node / wrong panel), the joint residual is large and NUDGE **abstains**
(``off-model``) — "the panel is not consistent with a single latent switch" — rather than
silently average an inconsistent panel into a confident call (``NUDGE-LIM-014``). With a
single reporter (``M == 1``) the consistency of the pinned gain cannot be checked, so the
affine is *not* pinned and the ceiling↔gain degeneracy remains — NUDGE returns
``unresolved``, exactly the abstention the panel is built to break.

**The per-condition batch/depth blind spot the consistency guard CANNOT see — and the
floor-consistency gate that closes it (``NUDGE-LIM-014``).** The consistency guard above is
computed on the **control** curves; it validates the reporters share one latent, but it is
*blind to a technical confound applied to the perturbed condition only*. A uniform
multiplicative scale ``c`` on the whole perturbed panel — a batch / sequencing-depth /
instrument-gain difference between the control-condition and perturbed-condition measurement
— is **consistent with** the shared latent (it scales every reporter by the same fraction),
so it sails past the consistency guard and aliases 1:1 onto a shared latent-ceiling change
``A = c`` (the exact ``ceiling`` signature). The discriminator is the **OFF baseline /
floor** (dose→0, latent OFF): a *genuine* ceiling change scales only the ON term
``gain·A·f`` and leaves each reporter's floor **unchanged**, whereas a per-condition batch
scale ``c`` multiplies the *whole* perturbed signal, so **every reporter's floor is rescaled
by ``c``** off its pinned control floor. So before a ``ceiling`` call NUDGE measures a
**floor-consistency statistic** (``off_on_coupling`` = how much the OFF baseline moved *with*
the recovered ON scale ``A``: ≈0 for a genuine ceiling, ≈1 for a batch) and abstains
(``unresolved``) when the floor is rescaled in lockstep with the ceiling. **The irreducible
residual (a BOUND, not a full close).** When the panel's floors are (near-)zero — no
measurable OFF baseline to anchor on — a batch and a genuine ceiling are *genuinely
inseparable* (both scale the pure ON-leakage identically), so NUDGE also abstains when the
floors are unmeasurable (``floor_measurability`` low). Separating a per-condition
multiplicative scale from a real ceiling on a (near-)zero-floor panel requires an
**independent depth anchor** (a spike-in, a housekeeping reporter, or a designated
no-response reporter) that NUDGE does not yet ingest — documented and locked in
``NUDGE-LIM-014``.

       poor, or some reporter fits its OWN Hill cleanly (``r2_independent`` high) yet
       the shared latent explains it badly (``r2_shared`` low) — it reads a
       *different* latent. NUDGE abstains rather than average an inconsistent panel.
    2. **unresolved (identifiability)** — the affine could not be pinned (a single
       reporter — the ceiling stays degenerate with the reporter gain, the very
       abstention the panel breaks), the winning knob does not beat the runner-up by
       ``knob_margin``, or the bootstrap CI of the winner straddles 0.
    3. **no-effect** — the WT-latent null is nearly as good as the best knob
       (``effect_margin`` small): the perturbation did not move the latent.
    4. **threshold / gain / ceiling** — the winning knob beats the runner-up by
       ``knob_margin`` *and* the WT null by ``effect_margin`` *and* its bootstrap CI
       excludes 0.
    4c. **the ceiling-scoped floor-consistency gate (``NUDGE-LIM-014``)** — a ``ceiling``
       win is additionally checked against a per-condition batch/depth confound, which
       aliases 1:1 onto a shared ceiling change. If the panel's floors are unmeasurable
       (``floor_measurability`` < ``min_floor_measurability`` — a (near-)zero-floor panel with
       no depth anchor) NUDGE abstains ``unresolved``; if the perturbed OFF baseline is
       rescaled in lockstep with the recovered ON scale (``off_on_coupling`` >
